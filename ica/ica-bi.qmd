```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Load data
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")

# Check it out
head(elections)
```

Exercise 1: Quantitative vs Quantitative Intuition Check
```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point()
```
Exercise 2: 2 Quantititative Variables
```{r}
# Set up the plotting frame
# How does this differ than the frame for our histogram of repub_pct_20 alone?
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16))
```
```{r}
# Add a layer of points for each county
# Take note of the geom!
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point()
```
```{r}
# Change the shape of the points
# What happens if you change the shape to another number?
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point(shape = 3)
```
```{r}
# YOU TRY: Modify the code to make the points "orange"
# NOTE: Try to anticipate if "color" or "fill" will be useful here. Then try both.
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point()
```
```{r}
# Add a layer that represents each county by the state it's in
# Take note of the geom and the info it needs to run!
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = state_abbr))
```

Exercise 3: Reflect
> There is a positive, strong relationship between Republican support in 2020 and 2016. It doesn't seem to have a potential outlier.

Exercise 4: Visualizing trend
```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```
Part a
```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_smooth()
```
Part b
```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Exercise 5: Your Turn
```{r}
# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_rent)) +
  geom_point()


# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_age)) +
  geom_point()
```

Exercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot
```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +
  geom_point()
```

Exercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical - Violins & Boxes
```{r}
# Side-by-side violin plots
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +
  geom_violin()
```
```{r}
# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Exercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical - Intuition Check
```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density()
```

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) +
  geom_density()
```

Exercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical-Density Plots
```{r}
# Name two "bad" things about this plot
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density()
```
```{r}
# What does scale_fill_manual do?
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red"))
```
```{r}
# What does alpha = 0.5 do?
# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red"))
```
```{r}
# What does facet_wrap do?!
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red")) +
  facet_wrap(~ historical)
```
```{r}
# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.
# Why is this terrible?
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red"))
```

Exercise 10
> I like boxplots the best.
> Density plots allow us to see the trends change in the plot which boxplots do not allow.
> Density plots don't tell us where is the point of 25% and 75% of the data, which boxplots show.

Exercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical-Intuition Check
```{r}
# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot
ggplot(elections, aes(x = historical)) +
  geom_bar()
```
```{r}
# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot
ggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Exercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical
```{r}
# A stacked bar plot
# How are the "historical" and "winner_20" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play?
ggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar()
```
```{r}
# A faceted bar plot
ggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ historical)
```
```{r}
# A side-by-side bar plot
# Note the new argument to geom_bar
ggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```
```{r}
# A proportional bar plot
# Note the new argument to geom_bar
ggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

Part a
> pro = easier to compare the relative outcomes in blue vs purple vs red states con = lose track of how many counties fall into blue vs purple vs red states

Part b
> I like the last bar plot because it reveals the percentarge  of dem and repub in a clear way.

Exercise 13: Practice
```{r}
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv")
```

```{r}
# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = location)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
```{r}
# How might we predict the 3pm temperature (temp3pm) by the 9am temperature (temp9am)?
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am)) + 
  geom_point()
```
```{r}
# How do the number of rainy days (raintoday) differ by location?
ggplot(weather, aes(x = location, fill = raintoday)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```
