```{r}
# Import and check out data
library(ggplot2)
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
head(education)
```

Exercise 1: SAT scores Part a

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Part b \> The distribution of SAT scores is unimodal, right-skewed, with a few gaps. The median SAT score is roughly 900 and the data ranges from 850 to 1100)

Exercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries Part a

```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs expend
# Include a "best fit linear regression model" (HINT: method = "lm")
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat, y = expend)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs salary
# Include a "best fit linear regression model" (HINT: method = "lm")
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat, y = salary)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Part b \> It seems that when SAT scores increase, the spending and salary would decrease. Yes this suprises me because I would expect an increase in spending and salary.

Exercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending and Teacher Salaries

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat, y = salary, color=expend)) +
  geom_point()
```

Exercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 2))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```

Exercise 5: Finally and Explanation
Part a
```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat)) +
  geom_bar()
```
Part b
```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat, fill = fracCat)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
> The more students in a state that take the SAT, the lower the average scores tend to be. This is probably related to self-selection.

Part c
```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat, y = expend, fill = fracCat)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
> When we control for the fraction of students that take the SAT, SAT scores increase with expenditure.

Part d
> Student participation tends to be lower among states with lower expenditures (which are likely also the states with higher ed institutions that havenâ€™t historically required the SAT). Those same states tend to have higher SAT scores because of the self-selection of who participates.
