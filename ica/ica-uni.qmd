Use this file for practice with the **univariate viz** in-class activity.  Refer to the class website for details.

Exercise 1
```{r}
# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```

```{r}
head(hikes)
```
> a. how many bikes are there in each category? are any categories more common than others?
> b. What's a typical elevation? What's the range in elevations?

Exercise 2: Load tidyverse
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# Use the ggplot function
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))
```
```{r}
# Load the package
library(tidyverse)
```
Exercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1
```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))
```
> Just a blank canvas.
> Name of the dataset
> Indicate which variable to plot on x-axis
> Aesthetics

Exercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2
```{r}
# Add a bar plot LAYER
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar()
```
```{r}
# Add meaningful axis labels
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
```
```{r}
# FILL the bars with blue
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
```
```{r}
# Colors the outline of the bars in orange
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "orange", fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
```
```{r}
# Change the theme to a white background
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "orange", fill = "blue")  +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Exercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up
> Part a
> To indicate we're still adding layers to / modifying our plot
> Bars are the geometric elements we're adding in this layer
> Labels
> Fill fills in the bars. Color outlines the bars

> Part b
> Most hikes are moderate, the fewest number are difficult

> Part c
> I don’t like that the categories are alphabetical, not in order of difficulty level.

Exercise 6: Sad Bar Chart
```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Elevation", y = "Number of hikes")
```

Exercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation
> Part a
> 6
> 1+1=2

> Part b
> Elevations range from roughly 3700 to 5500 feet. Elevations vary from hike to hike relatively normally (with a bell shape) around a typical elevation of roughly 4500 feet.

Exercise 8: Building Histograms = Part 1 
```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation))
```
Exercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2
```{r}
# Add a histogram layer
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
```{r}
# Outline the bars in white
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") 
```
```{r}
# Fills the bars in blue
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blue") 
```
```{r}
# Add axis labels
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```
```{r}
# Change the width of the bins to 100 feet
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```
```{r}
# Change the width of the bins to 5 feet
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 5) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```
```{r}
# Change the width of the bins to 200 feet
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

Exercise 10: Histogram Follow-up
> geom_histogram()
> color outlined the bars and fill filled them
> easier to distinguish between the bars
> changed the bin width
> we lump too many hikes together and lose track of the nuances
> we don’t lump enough hikes together and lose track of the bigger picture trends

Exercise 11: Density plots
```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
 geom_density(color = "blue", fill = "orange")
```
