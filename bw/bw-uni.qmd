Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Hike Elevations",
    subtitle = "Data from High Peaks region",
    x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes",
    caption = "Source: High Peaks data"
  )
```
