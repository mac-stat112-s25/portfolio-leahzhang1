```{r}
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point(aes(label = state_abbr)) + labs(
    title = "Comparison of Republican Vote Percentages (2016 vs 2020)",
    subtitle = "Data by County",
    x = "Republican Vote Percentage (2016)",
    y = "Republican Vote Percentage (2020)",
    caption = "Source: 2020 Election County Data"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE)
