Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
# Import and check out data
library(ggplot2)
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
head(education)
```
```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat, y = salary, color=expend)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between SAT Scores and Teacher Salaries",
    subtitle = "Colored by Expenditure per Student",
    x = "Average SAT Score",
    y = "Average Teacher Salary (USD)",
    caption = "Source: SAT and Salary Data")
```
