Use this file to generate a professional looking **spatial** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

fave_places <- read.csv("https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/our_fave_places.csv")

# Load the leaflet package
library(leaflet)

# Just a plotting frame
leaflet(data = fave_places)

leaflet(data = fave_places) |> 
  addTiles() |> 
  addMarkers()

```
