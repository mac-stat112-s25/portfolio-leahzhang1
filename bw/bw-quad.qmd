Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Import data
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  

ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ raintoday) +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature Comparison: 9 AM vs 3 PM",
    subtitle = "Faceted by Rain Today Status",
    x = "Temperature at 9 AM (°C)",
    y = "Temperature at 3 PM (°C)",
    caption = "Source: Weather Data for 3 Locations"
  )
```
